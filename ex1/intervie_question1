Use weighted quick union path compression algorithm,i.e,an integer array id[] to store parent node,another integer array size[] to store number of nodes rooted to it.When two members form membership,union them(find root of them,run path compression at the same time,change the root of node who has a smaller size,meanwhile,update another node's size value),each time after  union two nodes,check if the updated size equals to n or not.If so,all members are connected.
